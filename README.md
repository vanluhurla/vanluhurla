### 👋 Hi there 

I am an iOS developer with professional experience, creating apps from scratch and taking ideas from discovery and prototypes through TestFlight to the App Store. 

I write clean, tested Swift/SwiftUI and care about performance, accessibility and privacy. 

With a Product Owner background, I collaborate well in Agile teams, communicate clearly and keep delivery moving. 

I’m keen to keep learning and contribute to thoughtful, user-centred mobile experiences.

### 👩🏻‍💻 My process 

I’ve been learning and building iOS apps since 2022, focusing on Swift/SwiftUI, clean architecture and testing. I enjoy turning ideas into polished, user-friendly products and I’m always improving performance, accessibility and UX details as I go.
